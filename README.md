# INTO-University-Partnership-Live-Brief-

### Executive Summary ###

Analytical insights from the Fall Enrolment of Students to the universities in the USA over the years 2014 - 2020 show that there is a decline in international students especially after 2018 in many states. I believe there is a need to focus on the recruitment of international students targeting the states that attract the highest number of international students, and choosing the universities that are affordable and attractive in location.

### Business Objective ###

INTO University Partnerships is considering the expansion of its portfolio in the USA and would like to target potential new partner universities/colleges who fit the following criteria. 

The universities must be in a state:

* Which is proven to be highly attractive to international students.
* Where INTO does not currently have a university partner.
* With a relatively affordable price point for undergraduate study.

### Problem Statement ###

Looking at the analytical insights, it’s observed that there is a decrease in the number of international students after 2018. The decline in the number of international students can really impact the University budgets. On top of shrinking the university budget, lower enrolment could increase costs for domestic students, and impact the US economy.

### Recommendations ###

Various options and alternatives were analysed to filter the list of the top 20 Universities which will have impactful partnerships with INTO towards success and increasing the number of international students pursuing a 4-year undergraduate degree.

### Justifications ###
* The top 10 states that are attracting the highest number of international students (source: https://www.statista.com) are considered and filtered in the list of universities based on the location which is urban, suburban and town within 10 miles from the suburb.
* Also compared the percentage of international students in a particular university to the State benchmark. (Source: https://www.applyboard.com)
* The top 50 universities that have the highest enrolments of international students over the time 2017 – 2020 are sorted.
* From the top 50 universities, the top 20 universities are then sorted based on the tuition fees taking affordability into consideration.
